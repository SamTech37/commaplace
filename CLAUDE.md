## 1. Think Before Coding

State assumptions explicitly. If multiple interpretations exist, surface them — don't pick silently. If a simpler approach exists, say so. If something is unclear, stop and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. No features, abstractions, configurability, or error handling beyond what was asked. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it. "Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?" — if yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Don't improve adjacent code, refactor what isn't broken, or reformat. Match existing style. Note unrelated dead code; don't delete it. Clean up only the orphans your own changes created. Every changed line should trace to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define verifiable success criteria, then loop until met.
- "Add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass
- "Fix the bug" → write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass
- "Refactor X" → tests pass before and after

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


## 5. Dev Commands

See Makefile. Prefer `make watch` for hot-reload.

## 6. Adding Features Should Not Cause Regression in Existing Ones
